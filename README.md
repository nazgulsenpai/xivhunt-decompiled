# XIV-Hunt Version 5.2.1 (Final) Decompiled .NET Core 3.x Assembly

This repository is for educational purposes only. These sources were decompiled from non-obfuscated byte code of the previously open-source (MIT) XIV-Hunt client for Final Fantasy XIV. Since xivhunt.net is no longer operable and the original author has shut it down, this code is provided for preservation purposes.

Some features of the client (writing messages to FFXIV client chat, automatic performance, etc) are handled in a native dynamic library that was injected into FFXIV and is not included as no debugging symbols are present. The last available commit of the source code from the final MIT release of the XIV-Hunt client can be found here [https://github.com/nazgulsenpai/XIV-Hunt/tree/master/Hunt_x64](https://github.com/nazgulsenpai/XIV-Hunt/tree/master/Hunt_x64) and with a bit of research you can likely fill in the blanks.

The Solution and Project files provided will probably not work by default in your VS setup and may require tweaking.
