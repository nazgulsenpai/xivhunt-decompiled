# XIV-Hunt Version 5.2.1 (Final) Decompiled 

This repository is for educational purposes only. These sources were decompiled from non-obfuscated byte code of the previously open-source (MIT) XIV-Hunt client for Final Fantasy XIV. Since xivhunt.net is no longer operable and the original author has shut it down, this code is provided for preservation purposes.

The Solution and Project files provided will probably not work by default in your VS setup and may require tweaking.

This assembly was built using .NET Core 3.x
